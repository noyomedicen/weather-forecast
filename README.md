# weather-forecast

This is the first project of a course of data engineering, where we use a AWS instance to load the files and run the scripts.
With this project we run a python script that send myself a message everyday, warning us of hours of the day with a high probability of rain.
It works with a Twilio number, and it is connected to a weather api.
